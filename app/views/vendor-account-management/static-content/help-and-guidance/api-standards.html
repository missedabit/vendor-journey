        <p class="govuk-body">You will have received an email on 4th October regarding the API Standards (also provided below). APIs let applications talk to each other and share data, they are essential to our technical process.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">As you are an eligible Vendor, we will also be hosting a live Q&A session (between 18th October – 5th November) for any additional questions you might like to raise regarding the API build. A separate email invite will be sent to you on this shortly.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">To be able to test API integration, API stubs will be circulated to you on w/c 18th October on the HtG:D Vendor Portal. </p>
        
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">About</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Help to grow will be presenting a number of APIs for Vendors to engage with. Our APIs will align to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards" class="govuk-link" target="_blank">Government Digital Service</a> practices. Our APIs will be partner based Web APIs using REST specification.</p>
        
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Use</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Our APIs will be available to allow Vendors to interact with our services and will be presented via an api.gov.uk address in due course.</p>
        
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Access</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">Connecting to the APIs will require you as an organisation to be registered within the Vendor portal and to have provided us with an IP address(es) to allow your systems to connect to us. We will whitelist the IP address and provide an API key for access.</p>
        
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Making requests</h3>
        <p class="govuk-body">When receiving your key, we will also provide our API documentation allowing you to make calls to the system. All access will be monitored for the duration of each session.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">For further information, please see the Government Digital Service guidance on API Technical and Data Standards here: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards" class="govuk-link" target="_blank">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/gds-api-technical-and-data-standards</a>.</p>
